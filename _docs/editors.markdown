{% include h title="Emacs" %}

To bring some of the Emacs keybindings into your IDE, 
go to `Settings / Preferences | Keymap` and enable the **Emacs** keymap. 

If you are used to <kbd>M-x</kbd>, consider remapping the `Find Action` binding to this shortcut in the `Keymap` settings. 
 
For more Emacs extensions, try the [Emacs+Patched](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10045-emacs-patched) plugin.


{% include h title="Vim" %}

To get Vim emulation in the IDE, use the [IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim) plugin. 
It adds motion keys, marks, registers, and visual mode commands.
